Student team project making an introductory level to a bigger game

My involvement in this project was Modelling part of the objects, but most importantly the Audio Design of the game. 

For this, I decided how to best represent the mood of the level, recorded the Morse code interaction and other sound effects using simple Foley recordings. 

Additionally, I implemented the sounds and background music (composed by [Free Production Music by Jason Shaw](http://www.audionautix.com/ "Free Production Music by Jason Shaw")) into the game. 
For this I used multiple event trigger, location based sounds, interaction sounds, reverb volumes, audio volumes and more.

Developed in UnrealEngine 4.9
